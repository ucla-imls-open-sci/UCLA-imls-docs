### **Project Overview**

The UCLA Library, through the **IMLS-funded project** "Lessons for Librarians in Open Science Principles and Methods," is developing a robust, modular curriculum to train librarians in open science practices. The initiative aims to enhance librarians' ability to support researchers in adopting open science principles, fostering transparency, and engaging in reproducible research. 

This project leverages $237,839 in IMLS funding and a $46,598 cost-share to create **14 open science lessons**. These lessons are developed using an evidence-based, collaborative approach inspired by The Carpentries, emphasizing modularity and adaptability for various educational contexts.

#### **Key Objectives:**
1. Train librarians to become advocates and collaborators in open science.
2. Build a reusable curriculum tailored to librarians' roles in research ecosystems.
3. Align training with national and international open science standards, such as NASA's TOPS and UNESCO's recommendations.

#### **Scope of Work:**
- Establish a diverse review committee of researchers, librarians, and data professionals.
- Develop and publish calls for lesson proposals.
- Conduct two virtual summer schools to guide lesson authors through collaborative design and pilot testing.

#### **Intended Outcomes:**
- Equip librarians with the skills to effectively support and promote open science practices.
- Publish freely available lessons aligned with open science advocacy, ensuring long-term adaptability and global reach.
- Strengthen the role of librarians in advancing reproducibility, FAIR principles, and equity in research.

This project represents a transformative step in empowering librarians to meet the evolving needs of the research community through open science.
