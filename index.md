# Lessons for Librarians in Open Science Principles and Methods

The [UCLA Library](https://www.library.ucla.edu/) is leading an initiative to develop a modular curriculum that trains librarians in open science practices. This project is funded by the Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS) under the Laura Bush 21st Century Librarian Program and aims to enhance librarians' ability to support researchers in adopting open science principles.

---

## **Project Overview**

The project will result in **14 modular open science lessons** designed specifically for librarians, focusing on:
- Training librarians to become advocates for open science.
- Building a reusable curriculum tailored to librarians' roles in research ecosystems.
- Aligning with national and international open science standards, such as NASA's TOPS initiative and UNESCO's recommendations.

The curriculum will empower librarians to:
- Promote reproducibility and FAIR principles.
- Collaborate effectively with researchers and STEM professionals.
- Advocate for open science practices within their institutions and beyond.

## **Work Plan**

### Key Activities:
1. Establish a **Review Committee** of researchers, librarians, and data professionals.
2. Develop and publish a **Call for Lesson Proposals**.
3. Conduct two **Virtual Summer Schools** to guide lesson authors through collaborative design and pilot testing.
4. Publish lessons as **open educational resources (OERs)** for broad reuse and remixing.

### Timeline:
- **2022-2025**: Development, piloting, and refinement of lessons.
- **Winter 2025**: Final rollout and dissemination through key networks such as Library Carpentry and NASA TOPS.
