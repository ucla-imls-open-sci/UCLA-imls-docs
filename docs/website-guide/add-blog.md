# Adding blogs posts 

1. Navigate to the `_posts` directory

2. On the top right corner: Add file -> create new file 

    ![create new blog]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/website-guide/add-blog-2.png)
    
    **Note** The naming convention of these .md files is important, and must follow the format: '`YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP`'. The permalinks can be customized for each post, but the date and markup language are determined solely by the file name.

3. Update the title, layout and author of the file

    ![update blog information]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/website-guide/add-blog-3.png)

4. Your new blog should now show up on the website after you push and deploy your changes!
